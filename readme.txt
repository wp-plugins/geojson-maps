Allows people to display GeoJSON feeds on a map.

== Description ==

GeoJSON Maps facilitates displaying multiple GeoJSON feeds on a map.  It has a custom legend to toggle on/off each data layer.  The map can be displayed on a Wordpress post or page via a short code.  All you need is some [GeoJSON](http://geojson.org/) feeds (both json and jsonp) and some styling markup.  See [here](http://demo.planningpress.org/map/) for a demo.  

GeoJSON Maps uses [Argo](https://github.com/openplans/argo).  Its configuration is provided [here](https://github.com/openplans/argo/wiki/Configuration-Guide).  Take note of the "rules" and "popupContent" items to be entered when setting up a layer.  So, in the Schools layer from the [demo](http://demo.planningpress.org/map/), "Layer Rules" is set to:

    [{
      condition: '"{{LOCLEVEL}}" === "Elementary School"',
      style: {color: 'green', radius: 3, opacity: 0.9, fillOpacity: 0.2}
    },
    {
      condition: '"{{LOCLEVEL}}" === "Middle Secondary"',
      style: {color: 'orange', radius: 3, opacity: 0.9, fillOpacity: 0.2}
    },
    {
      condition: '"{{LOCLEVEL}}" === "High School"',
      style: {color: 'red', radius: 3, opacity: 0.9, fillOpacity: 0.2}
    }]

And "Popup Text" is set to: 

    {{LOCNAME}}
